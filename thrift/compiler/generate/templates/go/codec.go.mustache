    NOTE:
    Unfortunately map literals cannot be used to store metadata, due to a bug
    in the Go compiler: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33437
    The bug results in a "NewBulk too big" compilation error for some very large schemas.
    The workaround is to create slice literals (one with keys, one with values),
    create an empty map during runtime and populate that map from the two slices.
